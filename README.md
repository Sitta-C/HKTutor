# HKTutor

HKTutor is a pnpm monorepo containing the web client, API service, and shared TypeScript configuration for the initial project workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `24.19.0` (see [`.node-version`](.node-version))
- pnpm `11.19.0` (the version recorded in the root `packageManager` field)

Enable Corepack if pnpm is not already available:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.19.0 --activate
```

## Install

Install from the repository root. For a clean or CI installation, use the lockfile-enforcing command:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Use `pnpm install` only when intentionally updating dependencies and the committed root `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Development and checks

Run all workspace commands from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm verify:workspace
pnpm check
```

`pnpm dev` starts both application packages concurrently. The intended local URLs are:

- Web: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- API: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The web development server always uses port `3000`. The API defaults to `3001` and may be moved without affecting the web server by setting `PORT` on the root command:

```sh
PORT=3002 pnpm dev
```

`pnpm lint` is read-only and treats warnings as failures. To apply API lint fixes intentionally, run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api lint:fix
```

To operate on one package, use pnpm filters:

```sh
pnpm --filter @hktutor/web dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/web build
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api test
```

## Repository boundaries

- `apps/web` — Next.js web client (`@hktutor/web`)
- `apps/api` — NestJS API service (`@hktutor/api`)
- `packages/tsconfig` — shared strict TypeScript baseline (`@hktutor/tsconfig`)
- Root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` — the sole workspace and dependency-install authority

Do not run per-package installs or add nested lockfiles. Dependencies belong in the package that consumes them and are resolved by the root pnpm workspace.

## Deferred work

This initial workspace intentionally excludes later-sprint infrastructure and product features, including Redis, queues/brokers, Socket.IO, Prisma, Supabase, Docker, and application-specific implementation.
