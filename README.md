# HKTutor

HKTutor is a pnpm monorepo containing the web client, API service, and shared TypeScript configuration for the initial project workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `24.19.0` (see [`.node-version`](.node-version))
- pnpm `11.19.0` (the version recorded in the root `packageManager` field)

Enable Corepack if pnpm is not already available:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.19.0 --activate
```

## Install

Install from the repository root. For a clean or CI installation, use the lockfile-enforcing command:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Use `pnpm install` only when intentionally updating dependencies and the committed root `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Development and checks

Run all workspace commands from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm verify:workspace
pnpm check
```

`pnpm dev` starts both application packages concurrently. The intended local URLs are:

- Web: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- API: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The URL assignment is an architectural reservation for the concurrent development command. Runtime port enforcement and smoke verification are deferred to the next task.

To operate on one package, use pnpm filters:

```sh
pnpm --filter @hktutor/web dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/web build
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api test
```

## Repository boundaries

- `apps/web` — Next.js web client (`@hktutor/web`)
- `apps/api` — NestJS API service (`@hktutor/api`)
- `packages/tsconfig` — shared strict TypeScript baseline (`@hktutor/tsconfig`)
- Root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` — the sole workspace and dependency-install authority

Do not run per-package installs or add nested lockfiles. Dependencies belong in the package that consumes them and are resolved by the root pnpm workspace.

## Deferred work

This initial workspace intentionally excludes later-sprint infrastructure and product features, including Redis, queues/brokers, Socket.IO, Prisma, Supabase, Docker, and application-specific implementation. The following task performs full workspace checks and verification-driven runtime repairs, including the local development port behavior.
