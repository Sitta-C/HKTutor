# HKTutor API

NestJS 11 API using Prisma/PostgreSQL, local email/password authentication, JWT access tokens,
rotating refresh sessions, and Resend verification email.

Run commands from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api test
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api build
```

All controller routes receive the global `/api/v1` prefix. Authentication endpoints are under
`/api/v1/auth`:

- `POST /register`
- `POST /verify-email`
- `POST /resend-verification`
- `POST /login`
- `POST /refresh`
- `POST /logout`
- `GET /me`

## Source layout

- `src/modules/` contains runtime features: auth, bookings, health, profiles, and tutors.
- `src/infrastructure/` contains technical adapters shared by features, currently database and
  email.
- `src/common/` and `src/config/` contain cross-feature utilities and configuration.
- `src/generated/` contains generated Prisma code and must not be edited manually.
- `docs/examples/` contains documentation-only NestJS examples that are not registered at runtime.
- `scripts/` contains operational scripts that are type-checked separately from the Nest build.

Use the matching absolute alias when importing application code: `@app/*`, `@modules/*`,
`@infrastructure/*`, `@common/*`, `@config/*`, `@generated/*`, or `@examples/*`. Keep each feature
directory flat until its size makes a further split clearly useful.

Access tokens are Bearer JWTs. Refresh tokens are never returned in JSON; they are stored in an
HttpOnly cookie and rotated against hashed `AuthSession` records.

Protect an endpoint and restrict its roles by running authentication before authorization:

```ts
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(Role.ADMIN)
@Get('admin-only')
readAdminResource(@CurrentUser() user: AuthenticatedUser) {
  return { userId: user.id, role: user.role };
}
```

`JwtAuthGuard` verifies the token and active session first. `RolesGuard` then compares the latest
database-backed role attached to `request.auth`. A missing login returns 401; a logged-in user with
the wrong role returns 403. Routes without `@Roles(...)` are not role-restricted.

Configure the API through the root `.env.example`. Startup rejects missing or placeholder JWT,
Resend, and sender values outside the test environment. The access and refresh secrets must be
different and at least 32 characters.

## Database

Generate and validate the Prisma schema without changing a database:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:validate
```

The local-auth migration is a one-shot demo migration that deletes existing identity-owned demo
records before replacing the external identity fields. Do not apply it to a database containing
data that must be retained.

Tutor qualification uploads persist only private-storage metadata in `TutorDocument`; file bytes
remain outside PostgreSQL. The database accepts PDF, JPEG, or PNG metadata up to 5 MiB, keeps the
private object path unique, and permits only an administrator to move a pending review to verified
or rejected. Public or signed download URLs must remain transient and are never stored in this
table.

After confirming the target is disposable and filling the seed email/password values:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:status
pnpm db:migrate:deploy
pnpm db:seed
```

The optional `db:verify:sprint1` command runs only against an explicitly approved local disposable
database; see the repository README for its safety gate.
