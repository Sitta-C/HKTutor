# HKTutor API

NestJS 11 API using Prisma/PostgreSQL, local email/password authentication, JWT access tokens,
rotating refresh sessions, and Resend verification email.

Run commands from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api dev
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api test
pnpm --filter @hktutor/api build
```

Authentication endpoints are under `/api/auth`:

- `POST /register`
- `POST /verify-email`
- `POST /resend-verification`
- `POST /login`
- `POST /refresh`
- `POST /logout`
- `GET /me`

Access tokens are Bearer JWTs. Refresh tokens are never returned in JSON; they are stored in an
HttpOnly cookie and rotated against hashed `AuthSession` records.

Protect an endpoint and restrict its roles by running authentication before authorization:

```ts
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(Role.ADMIN)
@Get('admin-only')
readAdminResource(@CurrentUser() user: AuthenticatedUser) {
  return { userId: user.id, role: user.role };
}
```

`JwtAuthGuard` verifies the token and active session first. `RolesGuard` then compares the latest
database-backed role attached to `request.auth`. A missing login returns 401; a logged-in user with
the wrong role returns 403. Routes without `@Roles(...)` are not role-restricted.

Configure the API through the root `.env.example`. Startup rejects missing or placeholder JWT,
Resend, and sender values outside the test environment. The access and refresh secrets must be
different and at least 32 characters.

## Database

Generate and validate the Prisma schema without changing a database:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:validate
```

The local-auth migration is a one-shot demo migration that deletes existing identity-owned demo
records before replacing the external identity fields. Do not apply it to a database containing
data that must be retained.

After confirming the target is disposable and filling the seed email/password values:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:status
pnpm db:migrate:deploy
pnpm db:seed
```

The optional `db:verify:sprint1` command runs only against an explicitly approved local disposable
database; see the repository README for its safety gate.
